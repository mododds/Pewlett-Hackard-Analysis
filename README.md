# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7 work (SQL)

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is:
1) to determine the number of employees who are reaching retirement eligibility from each department
2) to determine which employees are eligible for the mentorship program

## Results
The following can be determined based on the analysis completed at PH.
- 70% of employees who are eligible for retirement are Senior Engineers(36%) and Senior Staff (34%)
  - [See attached pie chart for employee breakdown by title](https://github.com/mododds/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Retiring_pie.png)  
- 69% of employees who are eligible for the mentorship program are Senior Staff (37%) and Engineers (32%)
  - [See attached copy of pivot table for mentorship program analysis](https://github.com/mododds/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Mentor_pivot.png) 
- Hire dates for employees eligible for retirement span from 1085 to 2002
- Only 2 managers across the company are eligible for retirement

## Summary
1) A total of 72,458 employee roles will likely need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact:
- 25916	Senior Engineers
- 24926	Senior Staff
- 9285	Engineers
- 7636	Staff
- 3603	Technique Leaders
- 1090	Assistant Engineers
- 2	Managers

2) There will not be enough staff available to mentor the new wave of employees as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact:
- Biggest gap will be with Senior Engineers, where we only have 169 mentorship eligible employees, but ~26K eligible for retirement
- We nave no managers eligible for the mentorship program
- If all eligible employees choose to retire and PH is looking to replace all retired employees,
  - Assistant engineers and engineers are currently in the best position for the mentorship program:
    - Assistant Engineers have 7% coverage (14 mentees per mentor)
    - Engineers have 5% coverage (19 mentees per mentor)
    - [See attached screenshot of additional mentorship data analysis](https://github.com/mododds/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/mentor_ratio.png)
